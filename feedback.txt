* There quite some more related work than what you have in Section 2.6. I'm
  not sure if you really want to go through a very selective history of design
  of signatures; rather, put a focus on implementations of crypto using vector
  instructions and in particular NEON. As discussed by e-mail, don't just
  focus on schemes selected by NIST.
