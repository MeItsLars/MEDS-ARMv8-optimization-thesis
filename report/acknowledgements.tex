\begin{abstract}
    First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors Peter Schwabe and Simona Samardjiska, without whose guidance and insights this thesis would not have been possible. Additionally, the suggestions and feedback of Ruben Niederhagen and Amin Abdulrahman were greatly appreciated. Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their everlasting support, motivation, and encouragement.
