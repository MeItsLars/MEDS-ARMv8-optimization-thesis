  abstract  = {In this paper, we show how to use the Matrix Code Equivalence (MCE) problem as a new basis to construct signature schemes. This extends previous work on using isomorphism problems for signature schemes, a trend that has recently emerged in post-quantum cryptography. Our new formulation leverages a more general problem and allows for smaller data sizes, achieving competitive performance and great flexibility. Using MCE, we construct a zero-knowledge protocol which we turn into a signature scheme named Matrix Equivalence Digital Signature (MEDS). We provide an initial choice of parameters for MEDS, tailored to NIST's Category 1 security level, yielding public keys as small as 2.8 kB and signatures ranging from 18 kB to just around 6.5 kB, along with a reference implementation in C.},

Actual systems are potentially at risk, including cryptographic tokens, network-based cryptosystems, and other applications where attackers can make reasonably accurate timing measurements.

We did the implementations for the fields GF(2n), using a standard basis, and GF(p). We discuss various design decisions that have to be made for the operations in the underlying field and the operations on elliptic curve points. In particular, we conclude that it is a good idea to use projective coordinates for GF(p), but not for GF(2n). We also extend a number of exponentiation algorithms, that result in considerable speed gains for DSA, to ECDSA, using a signed binary representation. Finally, we present timing results for both types of fields on a PPro-200 based PC, for a C/C++ implementation with small assembly-language optimizations, and make comparisons to other signature algorithms, such as RSA and DSA. We conclude that for practical sizes of fields and moduli, GF(p) is roughly twice as fast as GF(2n). Furthermore, the speed of ECDSA over GF(p) is similar to the speed of DSA; it is approximately 7 times faster than RSA for signing, and 40 times slower than RSA for verification (with public exponent 3).},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a high-security post-quantum stateless hash-based signature scheme that signs hundreds of messages per second on a modern 4-core 3.5GHz Intel CPU. Signatures are 41 KB, public keys are 1 KB, and private keys are 1 KB. The signature scheme is designed to provide long-term {\$}{\$}2^{\{}128{\}}{\$}{\$}security even against attackers equipped with quantum computers. Unlike most hash-based designs, this signature scheme is stateless, allowing it to be a drop-in replacement for current signature schemes.},

  abstract  = {We present our speed records for Falcon signature generation and verification on ARMv8-A architecture. Our implementations are benchmarked on Apple M1 `Firestorm', Raspberry Pi 4 Cortex-A72, and Jetson AGX Xavier. Our optimized signature generation is {\$}{\$}2{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}2{\texttimes}slower, but signature verification is 3--3.9{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}faster than the state-of-the-art CRYSTALS-Dilithium implementation on the same platforms. Faster signature verification may be particularly useful for the client side on constrained devices. Our Falcon implementation outperforms the previous work targeting Jetson AGX Xavier by the factors {\$}{\$}1.48{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}1.48{\texttimes}for signing in falcon512 and falcon1024, {\$}{\$}1.52{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}1.52{\texttimes}for verifying in falcon512, and {\$}{\$}1.70{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}1.70{\texttimes}for verifying in falcon1024. We achieve improvement in Falcon signature generation by supporting a larger subset of possible parameter values for FFT-related functions and applying our compressed twiddle-factor table to reduce memory usage. We also demonstrate that the recently proposed signature scheme Hawk, sharing optimized functionality with Falcon, has {\$}{\$}3.3{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}3.3{\texttimes}faster signature generation and 1.6--1.9{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}slower signature verification when implemented on the same ARMv8 processors as Falcon.},

  abstract  = {In this work, we introduce a new code-based signature scheme, called FuLeeca, based on the NP-hard problem of finding codewords of given Lee-weight. The scheme follows the Hash-and-Sign approach applied to quasi-cyclic codes. Similar approaches in the Hamming metric have suffered statistical attacks, which revealed the small support of the secret basis. Using the Lee metric, we are able to thwart such attacks. We use existing hardness results on the underlying problem and study adapted statistical attacks. We propose parameters for FuLeeca and compare them to an extensive list of proposed post-quantum secure signature schemes including the ones already standardized by NIST. This comparison reveals that FuLeeca is competitive. For example, for NIST category I, i.e., 160 bit of classical security, we obtain an average signature size of 1100 bytes and public key sizes of 1318 bytes. Comparing the total communication cost, i.e., the sum of the signature and public key size, we see that FuLeeca is only outperformed by Falcon while the other standardized schemes Dilithium and SPHINCS+ show higher communication costs than FuLeeca.},
